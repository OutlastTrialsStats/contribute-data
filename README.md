# TOTStatsMonitor

A small companion app for [outlasttrialsstats.com](https://outlasttrialsstats.com). It sits in
your Windows system tray, watches The Outlast Trials' own log file while you play, and turns that
into two things: Discord Rich Presence, and community statistics.

It reads a log file the game already writes. It does not touch the game, its memory, or its
files, and it needs no launch options.

## Quick Start

**No Python installation required.**

[<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-TOTStatsMonitor.exe-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=windows" alt="Download TOTStatsMonitor.exe">](https://github.com/OutlastTrialsStats/totstats-monitor/releases/latest/download/TOTStatsMonitor.exe)

1. Download and double-click to run.
2. That's it.

The executable is not signed, so Windows SmartScreen will warn you the first time. Click "More
info", then "Run anyway".

The app copies itself to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TOTStatsMonitor\` on first run, so you can delete the
downloaded file afterwards. It also sets itself to start with Windows, so it is already running
the next time you play. Untick **Start with Windows** in the tray menu and the registry entry is
removed — that choice sticks, the app will not put it back on the next start.

## Features

### Discord Rich Presence

Shows what you are currently playing on your Discord profile: which trial, where it takes place,
which difficulty, how full the party is, and how long you have been in there. The trial artwork
comes along with it, and a button that links to your stats page. Escalation shows which step you
are on, Invasion whether you are the Imposter or a Reagent. Outside a trial it says so too: main
menu, Sleep Room, looking for a group.

It only ever shows something while the game is running, and it needs the Discord desktop app open.
Untick **Discord Rich Presence** in the tray menu and your status is cleared immediately.

### Contribute player data

While you are in a match, the app picks up the profile IDs of the players you meet and sends them
to outlasttrialsstats.com. That is how new players get discovered and added to the community
statistics database — the site can only track players it already knows about.

All contributors automatically receive an exclusive contributor badge on their profile at
outlasttrialsstats.com.

Only profile IDs are sent, theirs and yours as the contributor. No names, no chat, nothing about
your own performance. You can watch exactly what happens in the Console window, and switch the
whole thing off from the tray menu without uninstalling.

## System Tray

The app runs in the background and shows an icon in the Windows system tray (bottom-right, behind
the `^` arrow). Right-click it for the menu:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Whether it is monitoring, waiting for the game, or paused |
| **Contribute player data** | Turns contributing on or off immediately, without uninstalling |
| **Discord Rich Presence** | Shows or hides what you are playing on your Discord profile |
| **Start with Windows** | Adds or removes the autostart entry |
| **Console** | A live log window: detected players, API responses, errors |
| **Uninstall** | Removes autostart, deletes the installed files, and shuts down |
| **Exit** | Stops the app without uninstalling |

Everything the app keeps lives in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TOTStatsMonitor\`: `settings.json`, its own
`monitor.log`, and the cached trial list. Uninstall deletes that folder and the autostart entry
and leaves nothing else behind.
